The pain is described as dull and discomforting, occurring at night and after eating, and is relieved by standing and walking. The patient&#39;s symptoms are concerning for potential cardiac ischemia. The recent episode of chest pain that radiated to the left shoulder and was relieved by nitropaste suggests that the patient may be experiencing angina. The patient&#39;s ability to walk 1 mile without stopping and 3 times a week with stopping in between suggests that he may have some degree of cardiac limitation. The patient&#39;s vital signs are stable, and he is currently receiving heparin drips. Further evaluation and management by a cardiologist are recommended to determine the underlying cause of the patient&#39;s symptoms and to develop a plan for further treatment and management.</div>

Two days prior to <br>admission, he had one episode of chest tightness and dyspnea. <br>This resolved without intervention, and his son took his O2 sat <br>with a home meter which was 97% on RA. The son did note some ___ <br>edema and spoke to Dr. ___ increasing his Lasix from 40mg <br>qam, 20mg qpm to 40mg BID, which was done. However, this am, the <br>patient again developed chest tightness and dyspnea, his O2 sat <br>was 85% on room air, so an ambulance was caleld. The patient <br>initially went to ___ and was found to <br>have troponin of 0.14 and was given ASA, nitro paste (still <br>applied on admission to the floor), morphine, lovenox, 80mg <br>lasix (rec&#39;d 20 from son in the morning prior to transfer to <br>OSH), placed on CPAP with improvement in symptoms and oxygen <br>saturation.

He experienced two episodes of chest tightness and dyspnea, with the second episode prompting an emergency department transfer. His oxygen saturation was 85% on room air, and he was treated with aspirin, nitroglycerin, morphine, and low-molecular-weight heparin. He was also given 80mg of furosemide and placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which improved his symptoms and oxygen saturation.</div>
